                        My role as Administrative Assistant at Georgetown Markets included scheduling and coordinating meetings, travel arrangements, and appointments for the owners. When I arrived, the business was storing data mainly on paper. I was able to develop a new filing system and implement new organizational practices that ended up saving the company	$3,000 per year in contracted labor expenses. I was also given the opportunity to train two new administrative assistance during company expansion to ensure that these new practice were followed in detail.

                        As a Special Education Teaching Assistant I primarily worked with students on varying levels of the autism spectrum. I provided positive directions for students' academic, social, and emotional well-being. I assisted the teacher in implementing, assessing, and updating IEPâ€™s based on student progress. Clerical duties were also involved such as taking attendants and reporting and documenting accidents and injury reports.
